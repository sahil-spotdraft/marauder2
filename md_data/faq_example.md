To add a user to a contract type:

1.  Navigate to **Workflow Manager** in SpotDraft.
    
2.  Create a new workflow or edit an existing one linked to the contract type.
    
3.  Go to the **Access Control** tab.
    
4.  Assign users or teams to roles such as **Creators, Viewers, Suggestors, Editors, or Signatories** by selecting them from dropdown menus.
    
5.  Save your changes to apply the user assignments.
    

This process controls who can access and interact with the contract type.
