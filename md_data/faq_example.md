**Introduction**
----------------

Contract types are a powerful tool in SpotDraft that help you organize your contracts, streamline your workflows, and automate certain processes. This article will guide you through creating new contract types, allowing you to customize SpotDraft to fit your specific needs.

You can create new contract types in two ways:

*   **From a New Workflow:** This allows you to define a new contract type while creating a new workflow from the ground up.
    
*   **From an existing third-party paper workflow:** This lets you create a new contract type from an existing third-party paper workflow.
    

**Creating a New Contract Type from a New Workflow**
----------------------------------------------------

Let's start by creating a new workflow from scratch:

**Step 1: Navigating to Workflow Manager**

In your SpotDraft workspace, click on the **"Manage" icon** and click on “**Workflow Manager**

**Step 2: Setting Up a New Workflow**

*   In the Workflow Manager, click the **"Set Up New Workflow"** button.
    
*   Select any workflow type, and give your workflow a name and description.
    

**Step 3: Selecting the Linked Contract Type**

*   In the "Linked Contract Type" field, click on the dropdown arrow.
    
*   This will open a list of existing contract types. To add a new one, click on the **"Add 'New Contract Type'"** button.
    
*   Enter the **name** for your new contract type.
    

**Step 4: Setting Access Controls**

*   SpotDraft provides you with granular control over who can access and interact with your new contract type.
    
*   Click on the **"Access Control"** tab.
    
*   Here, you can define roles for the new contract type, such as Creators, Viewers, Suggestors, Editors, and Signatories.
    
*   You can assign individual users or entire teams to these roles by clicking on the dropdown menu for each role and selecting the desired users.
    

**Step 5: Setting Default Signatories**

*   Click on the **"Set default signatories for New Contract Type"** tab.
    
*   You can choose the default signatories for contracts of this type.
    
*   You can select the default signatories from the list by clicking on the name of the desired user.
    

**Step 6: Saving Your New Contract Type**

*   Once you're satisfied with the settings, click **"Save."**
    
*   This will create your new contract type and link it to your new workflow.
    

**Creating a New Contract Type from an Existing Third-Party Paper Workflow**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also create a new contract type in an existing Third-Party Paper Workflow and link it:

**Step 1: Navigating to the Workflow**

*   Navigate to the third-party paper workflow you want to use as a base.
    

**Step 2: Opening the Linked Contract Type Dropdown**

*   Under the "**Workflow Details**" section, click on the dropdown arrow for the "Linked Contract Type" field.
    

**Step 3: Entering the Name of Your New Contract Type**

*   Click the **"Add 'New Contract Type'"** button.
    
*   Enter the **name** of your new contract type.
    

**Step 4: Setting Access Controls and Default Signatories**

*   Follow the same steps outlined in sections 4 and 5 above to set access controls and default signatories for your new contract type.
    

**Step 5: Saving Your New Contract Type**

*   Click on **"Save."**
    

**Important Notes**
-------------------

*   **Template Workflows:** You cannot create a new contract type for an existing template workflow.
    
*   **Locked Contract Types:** Once you create a template workflow, the contract type linked to that workflow is locked. You cannot change the linked contract type after the workflow is created.
