To update contract metadata:
1. Modify the Contract Metadata fields directly in the SpotDraft contract.
2. If integrated with HubSpot, changes sync automatically in real-time.
3. Ensure metadata mappings and data types are correctly configured for seamless synchronization.

This process keeps contract details current across platforms, enhancing contract management efficiency.
