Getting Started With The Workflow Manager
Introduction

SpotDraft's Workflow Manager is a powerful tool designed to automate and streamline your contract lifecycle processes. Whether you're managing contracts created by your organization or collaborating on a third-party paper, Workflow Manager empowers you to control every step of the journey with efficiency and accuracy.

What is Workflow Manager?

Workflow Manager is a flexible, no-code system that allows you to create custom workflows tailored to your specific needs. Think of it as a blueprint for your contract processes, guiding documents through a series of defined steps, approvals, and actions.

Why Use Workflow Manager?

By implementing Workflow Manager, you can:

Improve Efficiency: Automate repetitive tasks, eliminating manual processes and saving valuable time.
Boost Collaboration: Clearly define roles and responsibilities, ensuring everyone knows their part in the contract lifecycle.
Reduce Errors: Minimize human error through standardized processes and automated checks.
Gain Visibility: Track the progress of contracts at every stage, giving you real-time insights into your workflow.
Simplify Contract Management: Organize your contract documents and associated information with ease.
Types of Workflows

Workflow Manager supports two types of workflows:

1. Template Workflow: Ideal for creating contracts based on pre-defined templates, such as standard employee agreements or NDAs. This workflow helps you quickly and consistently generate contracts using your organization's approved templates.
2. Third-Party Paper Workflow: Designed for managing external contracts, allowing you to upload and track third-party documents for review, signature, and other required actions.
